# README

* Ruby version - 3.1.1

* Rails version - 7.0.2.3

Back-end for my master's project and a pet-project
for my personal growth as a developer.

This is an archive with books, courses, videos etc.
dedicated to NLP (which is 'natural language processing',
of course xD).
Even if a resource is a book, it is a design decision
to provide only a url to another site/store to
avoid copyright issues.

Topics I need to cover for my performance review:

* Assists in designing, implementation, and usage 
of API within internal or external standards and
policies ✅  
* Assists in data management, database design
creation, and modification activities, and query
language techniques usage ✅

the help of design patterns by using best practices
and approaches corresponding to competency 
profile ❌
* Assists in code implementation of components or
modules with the help of framework and it's 
extensions according to defined approaches and
practices ?
* Performs code implementation using a wide range
of primary language coding techniques and 
approaches ✅

modules and components according to best practices
within corresponding to competency profile ❌
